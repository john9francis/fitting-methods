# Fitting methods

Demonstrations of several different methods for fitting data to a function. The methods planned to be explored here are as follows:

- [ ] The least squares matrix method
- [x] [Grid search](grid_search/)
- [ ] Gradient search
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Simplex
- [x] [Genetic Algorithm](genetic_algorithm/)
